Repository Agents

This folder contains lightweight agents that own specific areas of the repository. See AGENTS.md at the repo root for global rules.

Agents:
- dataset: datasets and fixtures
- inference: inference runtime and evaluation
- ontology: static ontology and schemas
- planner: planning logic and tests
- state: entity state utilities and fixtures
- tools: CLI tools and scripts
- training: training pipelines and configs

Each agent directory contains `OWNERS`, `CHANGE_SCOPE.md`, and a `manifest.yaml` describing the agent.
